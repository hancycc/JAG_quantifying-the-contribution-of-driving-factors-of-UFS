The ​model_compare.py  evaluates and compares the performance of three tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and GBDT) to identify the best-performing model. 
The ​BO.py employs Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune model parameters. 
The ​RF_Classifier_RRU.py is responsible for selecting the optimal negative samples.
The ​RF_Regressor_Shap.py conducts SHAP analysis to interpret model predictions.
